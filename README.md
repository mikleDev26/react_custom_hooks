This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Custom Hooks Library


### `useFetch`

For now useFetch takes url as a parameter and returns an array [loading, error, data];

### `useReducerFetch`

Better version of useFetch with useReducer pattern.
For now useReducerFetch returns an object {loadin, error, data};
